# **Comparing model-based unconstrained ordination methods in the analysis of high-dimensional compositional count data**

This project contains code to reproduce the results of the paper with the same name by Tang, W., Korhonen, P., Niku, J., Nordhausen, K. and Taskinen, S.

The goal of the project was to compare different unconstraint ordination methods for high-dimensional compositional count data.
